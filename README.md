## Project Layers

- Web
    - Presentation layer
        - Here will be the access points to the functionalities of your services, their controllers, Frontend, etc.
- Application
    - This layer integrates with your services layer, think of it as an orchestrator.
    - If a certain functionality needs to search for something in the bank, it will call the Infrastructure functionality, repositories for example, to return information from the bank
    - If a certain functionality needs to fetch something in a third-party api, it will call the infrastructure functionality, some sub-layer of integration to return this information
    - If the information needs to be validated by the domain, the Domain Layers will be activated for such validation.
- Domain
    - Layer that encapsulates the entities and Interfaces of your project.
- CrossCuting
    - A separate layer that does not obey the layer hierarchy. As the name implies, this layer crosses the entire hierarchy. Contains features that can be used in any part of the code, such as, for example, CPF/CNPJ validation, external API consumption and use of some security.
- Infrastructure
    - The infrastructure layer serves to support non-domain responsibilities
- IoC
    - This layer is where the management of your project's dependency injections will be centralized.
    - Used when you want to reduce the coupling between different components/modules of a system
- Test
    - This layer has the responsibility to handle the unit testing of your entire project
    - It is in this project that the Tests and Mocks frameworks will be configured.
